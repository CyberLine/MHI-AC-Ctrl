You find the eagle schematic, the gerber files and the PCB in the [eagle folder](/eagle). Alternatively to the PCB you could use a breadboard.

## Connector
The AC provides the signals via the CNS connector. It has 5 pins with a pitch of 2.5 mm. It is out of the [XH series from JST](http://www.jst-mfg.com/product/detail_e.php?series=277). The position of the connector is visible on the following photo of the indoor unit PCB.

The PCB of the remote control uses also a 5 pin CNS connector but with a pitch of 2 mm. It is out of the [PH series from JST](http://www.jst-mfg.com/product/detail_e.php?series=199).
Please consider that there is no 1:1 connection between AC and the remote control. The Pins SCL and MOSI are (unfortunately) swapped. Your cable connection of the AC with the remote control PCB should consider that.

Please consider using an oscilloscope to confirm the layout of the pins before you connect the remote control PCB to your AC.


:warning: **Opening of the indoor unit should be done by a qualified professional because faulty handling may cause leakage of water, electric shock or fire!** :warning:

## Power Supply
The JST connector provides +12V. The DC-DC converter [TSR 1-2450](https://www.tracopower.com/products/browse-by-category/find/tsr-1/3/) is used to convert the +12V to +5V.

## Signal Connection
The ESP8266 SPI signals SCL (SPI clock), MOSI (Master Out Slave In) and MISO (Master In Slave Out) are connected via a voltage level shifter 5V <-> 3.3V with the AC. Direct connection of the signals without a level shifter could damage your ESP8266!
In a previous version I used a resistor voltage divider, but since the SPI of the AC has high impedance outputs, a voltage level shifter seems to be better. The voltage level shifters are bi-directional. That means the according ESP8266 pins (SCL, MOSI, MISO) could be inputs or outputs. You can use it for different [configurations](/Configurations.md).

## External Temperature Sensor
With version v1.4 of the software an external temperature sensor DS18x20 is (optional) supported. The layout of the MHI-AC-Ctrl PCB does support that connection. The DS18x20 is connected to GND, +3V3 and GPIO 4 (D2). Addtionally you need a 4k7 resistor between DQ and +3V3.

## Hints for Assembly
The photo of the assembled PCB shows a 2-pin-connector int the right top corner not mentioned in the bill of material.

I use this connector for test purposes. You should **not** solder this connector because if you short-circuit these pins e.g. by a jumper, then the AC power supply is short-circuited and could damage the AC. :warning:
